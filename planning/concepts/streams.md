Basically Observable<T> but shareable with people?

A shared text stream could emulate a chat client with two or more people emitting messages to it.

Other kinds of streams?

Other kinds of stream consumers?

Combinations of streams?

Webhook stream triggers?

Before getting too deep into "designing" what streams are, I need a simple place to help me elaborate this idea more. Markdown files in a directory are cool, but don't give me the experience I'm looking for. Also not reinventing Kafka here, need to have some actual inherent use for these things.

Use case: creating simple AI automations?
  Posting content to a stream could kick off a process with instructions for the AI configured per-stream. Do X when a new piece of content comes in, maybe posting to another stream.

Is this even a real idea for a thing to base an app around or is this just the general idea of message passing? Needs more elaboration.
